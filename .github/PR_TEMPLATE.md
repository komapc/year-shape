# Pull Request: Repository Restructure for Multi-Project Support

## 🎯 Overview

This PR reorganizes the repository structure to support multiple projects, transforming it from a single-project repository into a portfolio-style monorepo. The Year Shape Calendar project has been moved to its own subdirectory.

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE:** Complete repository restructuring

Users with existing clones will need to update their workflow:

```bash
git pull
cd year-shape-calendar  # New location
npm install
npm run dev
```
